<p>I&rsquo;m a graphics programmer from Sri Lanka currently working as a Developer Technology Engineer at <em>Imagination Technologies</em> in the United Kingdom. I have experience in developing high-end rendering techniques and doing low-level performance optimizations on PC and mobile platforms. I enjoy problem-solving on complex codebases and I&rsquo;m passionate about learning the latest and greatest graphics techniques and like to dabble in all aspects of game engine programming.</p>
<p>My main skillset includes proficiency with with C/C++ and multithreading, knowledge of advanced real-time rendering techniques, ray-tracing, low-level graphics APIs and experience with GPU profiling and optimization using tools such as RenderDoc, PIX and Nsight.</p>
<p>Apart from graphics, I&rsquo;ve had a long-time obsession with playing guitar and writing progressive metal music. I enjoy recording the occasional guitar cover from scratch along with all the mixing and mastering work, you can find one such cover below.</p>

</div>

<p>In addition to covers, I used to play in a few Sri Lankan bands, the most recent of which is a Progressive Metal band called <em>Constellation</em> where I played lead guitar and contributed to a lot of their original music. I&rsquo;m particularly proud of our 11-minute epic titled &ldquo;Pillar of Light&rdquo;.</p>
